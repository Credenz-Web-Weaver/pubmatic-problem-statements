Challenge: Efficient Data Exploration

Design a module that can efficiently fetch data from multiple tables. It should optimize the path by selecting the most efficient view based on the cost of querying each table. The module should form the backend query automatically based on the user's input and handle complex queries efficiently. It should provide real-time data exploration and analysis.

Judging Criteria:
Efficiency in fetching data, accuracy of the backend query, ability to handle complex queries, user-friendliness, and innovation.

Example:
Suppose there are two tables with different schemas and sizes. A user wants to execute a query to fetch data from them. Our module should optimize the query path and select the most efficient view to fetch the data.
